This repository is for practising the GitHub Flow. It is part of the course Software Development (Python).
I am learning about git, GitHub and how to work with it.

## A2 Conda Documentation
### Creating & Re-creating environments with Conda (Miniconda3)

My first mistake was the “--“ which did not copy correctly, so I got an error message. I quickly figured out that I had to use two hyphen and then it worked:

Now I could create the environment and load the packages:

I continued with the package installation and the options to activate/deactivate the environment were loaded as well:

After a small typing mistake the navigator loaded and started successfully:

=> also visible in the task bar
I installed JupyterLab and Orange 3.
Then I created a new environment and named it accordingly:

Creating a Backup was successful:

After I worked through the full tutorial, I downloaded the two .yml-files.
At first, I checked again if the two environments (**base** and **softdev_navigator** which I created) were there. After that I tried to navigate to the correct path were the downloaded yml-files were. I made a mistake here but resolved it by using *cd* and the path to navigate into the folder were I saved the files:

Afterwards, I created a new environment based on the yml-file. After a while, the process was completed so I could activate the new environment. I forgot to put the name of the new environment into command line but quickly realized my small error and continued:

Lastly I used *conda env list* to check, if the new environment was there:

The process was successful, so I followed the same process with the second file. After that, the task was completed:
